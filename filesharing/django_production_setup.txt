Steps to Set a Django Project in Production Environment
=======================================================

1. **Prepare the Codebase:**
   - Remove any debug/testing code.
   - Set DEBUG = False in settings.py
   - Set ALLOWED_HOSTS to include your server IP or domain.

2. **Secure the Application:**
   - Use a strong SECRET_KEY.
   - Set up CSRF and security headers.
   - Use HTTPS (SSL certificate via Let's Encrypt or others).

3. **Static and Media Files:**
   - Run `python manage.py collectstatic` to gather static files.
   - Configure web server (e.g., Nginx) to serve static and media files.

4. **Database Configuration:**
   - Use PostgreSQL or MySQL instead of SQLite.
   - Set up proper credentials and permissions.

5. **Install a WSGI Server:**
   - Install and configure Gunicorn or uWSGI to serve the Django app.

6. **Configure a Web Server:**
   - Use Nginx or Apache as a reverse proxy to forward requests to Gunicorn/uWSGI.
   - Ensure it handles static/media files and redirects HTTP to HTTPS.

7. **Environment Variables:**
   - Use `.env` files or tools like `python-decouple` to manage sensitive settings.

8. **Use a Process Manager:**
   - Use Supervisor or systemd to manage Gunicorn process and ensure app restarts if it crashes.

9. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Set up logging for Django and web server.
   - Use monitoring tools like UptimeRobot, Prometheus, or Sentry for error tracking.

10. **Deployment Workflow:**
    - Use Git for version control.
    - Automate deployment with Fabric, Ansible, or CI/CD tools.

11. **Regular Updates and Backups:**
    - Regularly update packages and OS.
    - Set up automatic database and media file backups.
